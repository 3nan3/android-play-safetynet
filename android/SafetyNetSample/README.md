Android SafetyNetSample Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates the SafetyNet API in Google Play Services. This API tests
whether the device and software have passed Android compatibility testing.
Use the
option in the toolbar to make an API request.
The next step is to read and verify the result of the compatibility check. This should be done on
the server side as shown in the 'server' component of this sample.
You can share the result of the API call from this app and use it as input into the server samples.

For more details, see the guide at https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html.
