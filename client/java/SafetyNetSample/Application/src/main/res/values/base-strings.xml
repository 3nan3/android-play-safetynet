            This sample demonstrates the SafetyNet API in Google Play Services. This API tests
            whether the device and software have passed Android compatibility testing.\n\n
            Use the option in the toolbar to make an API request.
            \nThe next step is to read and verify the result of the compatibility check. This
            should be done on the server side as shown in the \'server\' component of this sample.
            You can share the result of the API call from this app and use it as input into the
            server samples.
